        <!-- Section 3 -->
            <!-- What are some new concepts that were introduced that week? -->
            <div>We learned about APIs and asynchronous coding. Specifically how to use the fetch method. Here are some new terms we learned:</div>
            <!-- What are some key vocabulary words for that week, and what do they mean? -->
            <ul>
                <li>Asynchronous Function - A type of function in programming that allows other tasks to be run while it is being completed. </li>
                <li>API (Application Programming Interface) - A set of tools that allow different apps to communicate with other another, exchanging data</li>
                <li>Promise - The Promise object represents the completetion or failure of an asych function. It is used in place of callback functions because 
                    it is neater and easier to understand when reading code, thus avoiding 'callback hell'. </li>
                <li>Then - Used after the fetch function to indicate what is supposed to happen after an asynchronous function is completed </li>
                <li>Same Origin Policy - a security measure in web browsers that restrict web pages from making requests to different domains that the one it is hosted on</li> 

            </ul>
            <!-- What were some challenging aspects of that specific week? -->
            <div>Learning and understanding APIs was a challenge. I had issues with using the then method to retrive information form the API because I assumed that
                 I could turn the information into a json file and use it all in once then method.As it turns out, two then methods are required since one step (converting the file into JSON) 
                 needs to take place before the information can be read.</div>
            <!-- What are the workshops, capstones, or mini-projects that were completed that week, and what skillsets did they exercise?  -->
            <div>The excercises we did allowed us to practice retriving and manipulating data obtained from APIS using fetch and resolving promisies with the then method.</div>
