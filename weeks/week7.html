              <p class="card-text">For this week, we were presented with our second capstone. For our second 
                  capstone we were given the task to create an outdoors website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
                  and JavaScript. This was the first capstone where we had to use JavaScript, as the previous 
                  capstone only required us using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. For this capstone the goal was to
                  implement functional dropdowns and when an option is selected, to display that information 
                  to the users. We were also given an optional feature to implement which was to include an API 
                  that fetched the sunrise and sunset for the mountains we were given. Overall, this capstone gave
                  us the opportunity to show the skills we obtained during the weeks leading to our second capstone.
