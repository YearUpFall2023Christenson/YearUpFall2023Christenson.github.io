  <h1>Module 1</h1>
  <p>Workbook 3 starts us off with an in depth introduction to Javascript functions,
    Modularizing Code using Functions, as well as simple syntax that allows us to understand variables better.
  </p>
  <p>Some of the key concepts introduced were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>Parameters</li>
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>Scoping</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Vocabulary</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Function</li>
    <li>return (statement)</li>
    <li>Global scope</li>
    <li>Function scope</li>
    <li>var</li>
    <li>"use strict"</li>
    <li>Hoisted</li>
    <li>let</li>
    <li>const</li>
    <li>let</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Challenges</h5>
  <p>This week was full of new information for anyone that was not familiar with any JavaScript concepts.
    Functions were completely new information, with that came learning how to implement them and the
    logistics that comes with using functions as a facilitator in Javascript.</p>
