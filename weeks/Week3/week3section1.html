                <h2>1-1 Thinking about Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    Programming is essentially the process of telling a computer what to do<br>
                    -step by step- in a language the computer understands.
                </p>

                <h2>1-2 - Precision is Key</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Syntax and Logic</li>
                    <p>JavaScript relies on precise syntax and logical constructs.
                         Even minor errors can lead to code malfunction or unexpected behavior, making precision crucial for code correctness.</p>

                    <li>Debugging</li>
                    <P> Precise code is easier to debug and maintain. When errors occur, 
                        clear and precise code helps developers identify and fix issues more efficiently.</P>
                    <li>Performance</li>
                    <p>Precise coding practices can lead to more optimized and efficient code, improving the performance of JavaScript applications and reducing resource consumption.</p>   
                    <li>Code Readability</li>
                    <p>Precise code is more readable, making it easier for developers to understand and collaborate on projects. It enhances code documentation and promotes good coding practices.</p>    
                    <li>Consistency</li>
                    <p>Precise coding standards help maintain consistency across a project or team, leading to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.</p>    
                    <li>Avoiding Bugs</li>
                    <p>Precision helps in preventing common programming mistakes, such as type errors, logic errors, and unintended side effects, which can lead to bugs and security vulnerabilities.</p>    
                    <li>Cross-Browser Compatibility</li>
                    <p>Precise coding ensures that your JavaScript code works consistently across different web browsers, minimizing compatibility issues.</p>      
                </ul>
                <h2>1-3 JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language for web development. It enables interactive and dynamic web experiences
                     by running in web browsers. Some fundamental concepts include variables for storing data, data types like numbers and strings, and operators for performing operations on data. Control structures like conditional statements (if, else) and loops (for, while) help control program flow. </p>
                     <p>Functions allow you to encapsulate and reuse code, while objects and arrays enable structured data storage. JavaScript also interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate web page elements, enabling dynamic content 
                        updates and user interactions. Error handling, event handling, and asynchronous programming are essential aspects for building robust and responsive 
                        web applications.</p>
                        <h3> What can Javascript Do?</h3>
                        <p> Most of the scrips you write as a Web Developer will 
                            client-side scripts.
                        </p>
                        <p>Their primary purpose will be to make things happen in the browser.></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hide and show from fields</li>
                            <li>Validate form data</li>
                            <li>Submit data to a server for processing</li>
                            <li>Fetch data from a server  asynchronously</li>
                            <li>Dynamically create portions of the page</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>What Can't JavaScript Do?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No File System Access: JavaScript running in a web browser does not have direct access to the user's file system. It cannot read or 
                                write files on the user's device for security reasons.</li>
                                <li>Limited Network Access: Due to security restrictions, JavaScript cannot make cross-domain requests to access data from different websites, unless those websites explicitly 
                                    allow it using mechanisms like CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).</li>
                                    <li> Restricted Hardware Access: JavaScript running in a web browser has limited access to the user's device hardware, such as sensors, cameras, and microphones. Access to such hardware typically requires 
                                        user permission and may not be available in all 
                                        web environments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>JavaScript Code Structure</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Statements: JavaScript code is composed of individual statements that perform specific actions or tasks. 
                                Statements are usually terminated with semicolons (;).</li>
                                <li>Variables: Variables are used to store and manage data within a program. They are declared using the var, let, or const keywords, followed by a variable name.</li>
                                <li>Functions: Functions are blocks of reusable code that can be defined and called to perform specific tasks. They are declared using the function keyword and can take parameters and return values.</li>
                                <li>Objects and Arrays: Objects and arrays are data structures that can hold multiple values. Objects use key-value pairs, while arrays use ordered lists of values.</li>
                                <li>Control Structures: JavaScript includes control structures like conditional statements (if, else if, else) for making decisions, and loops (for, while, do...while) for repetitive tasks.</li>
                                <li>Events: JavaScript can respond to user interactions and other events by attaching event handlers to HTML elements. These handlers trigger functions when specific events occur.</li>
                                <li>Comments: Comments in JavaScript provide human-readable explanations within the code. Single-line comments use //, while multi-line comments are enclosed within /* */.</li>
                                <li>Error Handling: JavaScript allows for error handling through try...catch blocks to handle and respond to exceptions gracefully.</li>
                                <li>Scope: JavaScript has function scope, meaning variables declared inside a function are locally scoped, while variables declared outside functions have global scope.</li>
                                <li>Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, and async/await to manage tasks that may take time to complete without blocking the main program execution.</li>
                        </ul>
