        Lawrence Tejeda Profile Page
    </h1>

    <p>Hey! My name is Lawrence and some of my interests and hobbies align closely with contributing to my professional
        and personal growth. My passion started out with graphic design, where I leverage creativity to deliver visual
        solutions and now eagerly pursue to develop my programming skills. Beyong software development, I extend my
        mechanical knowledge to working on Mopar motors, while carpentry serves as an outlet for my hands-on creativity. 
        Complementing this, I maintain a disciplined approach to health and wellness through weightlifting. Additionally, 
        I enjoy some strategic relaxation through video games. Outside of professional pursuits, I cherish quality time spent with my children. I am committed to continuous learning,
        welcoming new challenges as opportunities for further development and expansion of my skill set.</p>
